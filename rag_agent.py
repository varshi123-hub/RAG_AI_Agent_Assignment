rag_agent.py - LangGraph RAG Agent with Citations

This module implements a simple RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) agent
using LangGraph. The agent follows this flow:

    [User Query] -> [Retrieve Chunks] -> [Generate Answer + Citations] -> [Final Response]

The graph has two nodes:
    1. retrieve  - Queries the vector DB for relevant document chunks
    2. generate  - Sends the chunks + question to the LLM for a grounded answer

WHAT TO MODIFY (for students):
    - SYSTEM_PROMPT  : Change the agent's personality and instructions
    - TOP_K          : How many chunks to retrieve (more = broader context)
    - LLM_MODEL      : Change the OpenAI model used for generation
    - TEMPERATURE    : 0 = deterministic, 1 = creative
    - retrieve()     : Try different retrieval methods (see comments inside)

# CONFIGURATION - MODIFY HERE
# ==========================================================================

# How many chunks to retrieve per query

# - Fewer chunks (2-3) = more focused, but may miss relevant info

# LLM SETTINGS - Students: experiment with these!

# Model to use for generating answers. Options:
#   "gpt-4.1-mini"     - Fast, cheap, good quality (default)
#   "gpt-4.1-nano"     - Fastest, cheapest, lower quality

# Temperature controls randomness:
#   0.0 = deterministic (same answer every time) - best for factual Q&A
#   0.7 = creative (varied answers) - better for brainstorming
#   1.0 = very creative (may hallucinate more)

# SYSTEM PROMPT - Students: this is the most fun part to modify!
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------
# This prompt tells the LLM HOW to behave and HOW to use the retrieved context.
# Try changing the tone, adding rules, or making it domain-specific.
#
# EXAMPLES TO TRY:
#   - "You are a medical expert. Use clinical terminology..."
#   - "You are a tutor. Explain concepts simply for a 10-year-old..."
#   - "You are a legal assistant. Always cite specific sections..."
#   - "Answer in bullet points only."
#   - "If you're not sure, list what you DO know and what's missing."
#
SYSTEM_PROMPT = """You are a cooking assistant.You must be describing the steps as a guide for making a recipie
GUIDELINES:
   - Lists ingredients first, then step-by-step instructions
   - Suggests substitutions for common allergens
   - Adds estimated cooking time and difficulty level
RULES:

1. Only use information from the provided context below.
2. If the context does not contain enough information, say so honestly.
3. At the end of your answer, add a "Sources:" section listing which \
documents and pages you used.

Context:
